# Jane Street Game

## Overview
I was working on a blog post to examine SBF's interview question when applying to work as an intern at Jane Street. The code in this repo is my attempt at exploring and simulating several different strategies for playing the game. I had to put this project aside awhile ago, but I intend to revisit it in the future to finish it (the bulk of the analysis is done, I just need to polish everything up.)

## The Interview Prompt:

“Here are ten coins, each differently weighted. One is a normal, evenly weighted coin, and thus has a 50% chance of landing on heads (or tails). The other nine coins are all unevenly weighted, though no two in exactly the same way. We’re not going to tell you how they are weighted, except to say that some are weighted to land more often on heads and some on tails. One coin might land on heads 62% of the time. You’ll be given 30 minutes to flip any coin you wish. You’ll be allowed to flip one hundred times in total. For every heads that you flip, you win one poker chip. 

How much are you willing to pay to play this game?”
